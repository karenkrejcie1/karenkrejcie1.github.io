    <h1>Creating a web page on Github</h1>
    <h2>Karen Krejcie's Version</h2>
    
    <h3>Step 1: Create an Account on Github.com</h3>
    <h5>Already have an account? Skip to Step 2.</h5>
    <p>Github is a cloud-based version control system as its core. There's a lot of functionality to Github, but the one
        we will use for this exercise is creating a public-facing website you can call your own!</p>
        <p>To get started, you have to give some details about yourself to Github. Nothing is free, remember. Let's 
            make it happen:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Navigate to the <a href="https://www.github.com" target="_blank">Github Sign-Up page</a>.</li>
                <li>Enter a valid email address you can access when prompted:<br>
                    <img src="signup.png" alt="Enter your Address">
                </li>
                <li>Next, enter a super sleuthy password that meets all the rules of being sleuthy:<br>
                    <img src="password.png" alt="Enter a password">
                </li>
                <li>Time to come up with a unique username.  Nice try, but "karenkrejcie" is already taken.<br>
                    <img src="username.png" alt="Enter a username">
                </li>
                <li>If you want to read through some product updates and occasional email from Github, now's your chance. Choose wisely.<br>
                    <img src="optin.png" alt="Optin to Emails?">
                </li>
                <li>Now it is time to be a human. Do whatever it says to be human.<br>
                    <img src="human.png" alt="Prove your human-ness">
                </li>
                <li>Create your account!<br>
                    <img src ="create.png" alt="Create yaccount">
                </li>
                <li>Login to your email used in #2 above, and retrieve the newly sent Launch Code<br>
                    <img src="launch.png" alt="Launch Code">
                </li>
                <li>Set up how your account will primarily be used.<br>
                    <img src="team.png" alt="Team Size">
                </li>
                <li>Install features as you see fit.<br>
                    <img src="features.png" alt="Lots of features">
                </li>
                <li>Pick a version. Any version.<br>
                    <img src="version.png" alt="Free or Apply for Student Version">
                </li>
            </ol>   
            <h3>Step 2: Create a repo(sitory) for your site</h3>
            <p>Github will keep track of various projects you're working on in "repos" or repositories. You can name them 
                anything you want NORMALLY. Since we are trying to make a web page on Github, we have to follow some Github
                protocols to have our free site.  Here we go.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Click on "Create a Repository" or "Start a Project":<br>
                    <img src="start.png" alt="Create a Repository">
                </li>
                <li>Name your Repository, but the name needs to be specific.  Enter: <span style="font-family: courier">username.github.io</span>, 
                    substituting <em>your</em> username for <span style="font-family: courier">username</span><br>
                    <img src="name.png" alt="Name your repository">
                </li>
                <li>Create whatever HTML file you want to show up on your website's home page, and name the file <strong>index.html</strong>. HOW do you do THAT, you ask?  That's outside the scope of 
                    this documentation, but here's a snippet of some code you could write in a plain ol' text editor (Windows: Notepad; Mac:
                     <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/textedit/work-with-html-documents-txted0b6cd61/mac" target="_blank">TextEdit with
                    preference changes</a>).<br>

                </li>
                <li>Upload your exisit</li>
            </ol>
